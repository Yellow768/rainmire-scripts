what if the wells are more important.

What if power, dash, groundpound, and levitate are granted at wells.

The player finds dash immediately. Then, part of Edward's plan is to find the other wells, looking for a power than can destroy the Soul Binder.

So maybe, with the reduced map size we have, we really only need 4 well locations, that cover three corners of the map, and then 1 in the middle close to the last boss.

The player will find groundpound next, and then levitate after. The last well will have a power that's just gives them the ability to destroy the soul binder.


There will be other ways of fast travel, like ones you pay for.
And there will still be scattered remnants, that just offer a respawn point close by.

Story



Edward needs you to infiltrate an old research facility, to discover if the Soul Binder has any vulnerabilities. You need to meet with
a soldier informant on some island to the west.

You head there, and perhaps something has gone wrong. The soldier has gone missing, insert some thing to overcome. The player discovers the location of the island, and a secret way in.

That secret way in leads to a well. Only the player can open it up because of their ability to use the Ancient Interfaces.
The well is on the island of the Site of the First Remnant.

This well grants the player Levitate, which the dungeon will use.

In this dungeon, the player meets an Aethelric Face Stealer, who informs the player that they haven't ever found a way to destroy a soul binder. in fact, this place is abandoned because they created a malfunction soul binder, one that created an unkillable monster. they were able to contain, but now, he's going to release it to protect imporant documents. The boss can be defeated, but it will get back up in a short time.

Stumped, edward comes to a realization. That the wells seemed link to some ancient belief. Marked with paintings of Gods.
Edward thinks that this may be an Elewer history thing, and knows that the influence of thoughts around a remnant can affect it. It's a long shot, but maybe there is another well that can help us with this.

He wants you to go out and find some Elewers, and ask some information.

Any elewer you find will direct you to some island, where a group of Elewers have made a base. There, they have knowledge that you seek, but
wont give it to you until you prove yourself worthy or convince them.

    -  ( Heart )Plea to them that peoples lives are on the line
      - They will want you to bring some evidence forth
    - ( Mind ) Show that you truly want to learn
      - They will want you to pass a knowledge test
    - Normal
      - Do some pilgramige thing
  
  Then, they will give you knowledge of the wells, and what they were for.

  1 Well celebrated the freedom of air. To not be bound by gravity (Levitate/Zephyr)
  1 Well celebrated the swiftness of water, to be fluid in your direction. (Dash/Aqueos)
  1 Well celebrated the gravity of earth. To be grounded, unmoving (Groundpound/Alkali)
  1 Well celebrated the ferocity of fire. To destroy, to start a new. (SoulBinder destroyer/ Drenor)

And where these Wells are

  The Elewers may not explicity say that they are for those gods, but they do say that those elements are celebrated.


Now you have a chance, find the Fire Well. There you will gain the ability to destroy Soul Binders.

With the propaganda and support of the people, you charge for the Fire Well, gaining the ability, and then charge for the Soul Binder, in order to destroy it and kill Aethelric for good.
