Dev Playthrough Shilo Notes

Truly not really sure if there's any value in having the dash ability needing to be recharged through water, especially if it's necessary
to complete the dungeon.

Things to try 
    - Make hydration slowly replenish itself anyways, so that the player is never truly stuck, but they can speed up the process by having food.
    - Make food restore the same amount of hydration as health, so that food items are not wasted in just replenishing health.
    - Make dash only take 2 hydration (1 whole circle) rather than 3
  
Lots of enemies respawn times were not set, making them respawn basically upon death.
On that, I think the respawn time can afford to be shorter than 500.

I dont think wandering is set up correctly for them. Or in any case, they should be set to not pause. Lots of enemies would not leave their starting position in the water.

Mush Hoppers hitboxes are wacky. Shielding is incosistent with them.


Water is still a little too laggy. The second rooms flooding should be more gradual anyways, as that would make more sense.

Hide dead body should always be on. It looks better.


Not all NPCS are responding to the status effects


Maybe need to set a config on the ancient interface that sets if it can be deactivated, or a delay between allowing it
