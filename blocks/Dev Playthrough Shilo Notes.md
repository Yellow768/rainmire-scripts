Combat feels bad.
    - Prongfish are not threatening at all. They're too slow, their attack is slow, and it doesnt even really hit because of the weird behavior of the projectiles.
      - Make attack faster
      - Summon more projectiles
      - Increase speed
    - Storm spiders whole deal is that they're threatening in swarms. So there should be more than 1 of them. Maybe make them smaller.
    - Mushroom Hoppers should also attack more often.
  
  The enemies that were supposed to start wandering around once the water filled up often just stayed in place, leaving the areas empty.
  There should be something more recognizable in the first area, so that players can orient themselves and recognize it when they see it through walls.

  Make sure to add the water replace water to each structure script.

  Too often its easy to just run away from an enemy and not have to deal with it.
